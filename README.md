# Macaw

Better password generation.

Named after our colorful feathered friends that speak (often nonsensical) strings of words.

## Password Generation

Macaw is a simple command-line tool to generate unique and easy-to-remember passwords.

Macaw uses a dictionary of easy to remember but hard to guess words and strings them together to create unique passwords.

Macaw supports lots of options for truly powerful and unique password generation.

Unlike a real Macaw, you can teach this one to not use certain words if desired.

## What makes a good password?

Passwords like `cUbXLBagmYPqKY35` are hard to guess, but they're also impossible to remember.

Meanwhile, passwords like `[correcthorsebatterystaple](https://xkcd.com/936/)`
are just as hard for computers to guess, but they are much easier for humans to remember.

Macaw seeks to generate passwords that are easy to remember so you don't have to dig into a password
manager every time you want to log into an app.
